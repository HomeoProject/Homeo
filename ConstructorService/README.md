# ConstructorService

## About

This is a Constructor Service built with Java 17 and Spring Boot designed to manage constructor and category related operations. The service integrates various features including RabbitMQ for pub/sub, PostgreSQL as a database, OAuth 2.0 with Auth0 for user authentication, Cloudinary for image storage, and more.

We have associated the constructor domain with categories because they are closely related and for now we don't see the point of separating them.
