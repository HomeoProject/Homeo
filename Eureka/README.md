# Eureka Server - Service Discovery

## About

Eureka, developed by Netflix, is a component of the Homeo application responsible for service discovery and load balancing in microservices architecture. It acts as a registry where all microservices are registered, and they can discover other services. Eureka Server provides a dynamic view of the entire system, allowing services to locate and communicate with each other without hardcoding hostnames or port numbers.
